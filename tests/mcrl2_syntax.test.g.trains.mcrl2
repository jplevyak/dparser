% This file describes several mostly incorrect algorithms to establish mutual exclusion.
% The correct version is also known as Peterson's mutual exclusion algorithm.
% For illustrative purposes the algorithm has been shaped as a pair of trains
% that must enter a common piece of track:

%        / --------------------<<-Train_q-<<------------- \
%       / /                                              \ \

%        \ ---                                       --- /
%          ---\-------------------------------------/---
%          p2  leave_p                       enter_p    p1
%              enter_q                       leave_q
%
% There are two trains, Train_p and Train_q, which must enter the common piece
% of track. Train p first passes detector p0 and p1. After that, it must wait
% for a semaphore Guard_p to allow the train to pass. It enters the critical
% section using an enter_p action, and leaves it using a leave_p action. Using
% a detector p2 train p indicates that it has left the critical section.
% Train q drives in the other direction and passes detectors q0, q1 and q2 respectively.
% Moreover, it passes guard Guard q and carries out enter_q and leave_q to
% indicate that it enters and leaves the critical section.
%
% The description below provides four different mutual exclusion algorithms,
% which can be indicated by the variable Invariant.
% Variant 1 is a strict alternation algorithm (access is strictly alternating)
% Variant 2 is the safe sluice (with total deadlock)
% Variant 3 is a correct version of Peterson's algorithm
% Variant 4 is a wrong version of Peterson's algorithm (no mutual exclusion)
%
% For each train there is a process and an auxiliary process (Train_p and Guard_p,
% Train_q and Guard_q). Furthermore there are three variables. A common boolean variable
% V and boolean variables Xp and Xq that can only be set by p, resp. q.
%
% In variant 1 the variable V is the only one that is used to determine access to
% the critical section. If V is true, train p can enter, and if V is false, train
% q can enter. Using the actions p1 and q1 trains indicate that they have left
% the critical section allowing entrance of the other train. What can nicely be seen
% when generating the reduced state space of this example, is that trains can only
% alternatingly access the critical region, and no train can access the critical
% region twice without the other having been in the critical region in between.
% Note the initial tau's that determine which train must enter the critical region
% first. The commands to generate the state space are (set Variant below to 1):
% mcrl22lps trains.mcrl2 trains.lps
% lps2lts trains.lps trains.lts
% ltsconvert -ebisim trains.lts trainsr.lts
% ltsgraph trainsr.lts
%
% In variant 2 (safe sluice) access to the critical region is regulated through the variables
% Xp and Xq. Trains indicate their desire to enter the critical region through
% p0 (resp. q0) setting Xp (resp. Xq) to true. In the guard they check whether
% the other train did not indicate the desire to enter the critical region. If
% so, the train can safely enter (i.e. pass the Guard).
%   There is an awkward situation in this case. If both trains indicate their
% desire to enter the critical region simultaneously, they both block the entrance
% for the other train, and the whole system will end up in deadlock. This is also
% clearly visible in the reduced state space. Another way to obtain the deadlock
% and a trace to it, is by using lps2lts -td trains.lps. It is also interesting
% to try to find the deadlock situation using the simulator (xsim). The deadlock
% can be reached in a very small number of steps. It turns out to be very hard
% to find using the simulator, if it is not known where the deadlock resides.
%
% The third variant is Peterson's mutual exclusion protocol. It is a combination
% of both access mechanisms above. On the one hand processes can enter through
% the mechanism of the safe sluice, where trains indicate their desire to enter.
% On top of that there is the variable V that guarantees alternated access if
% both trains want to enter. This yields a correct, deadlockfree protocol.
%
% In the fourth variant the sensors p1 and p0 are exchanged. This causes the
% protocol to be incorrect, as mutual exclusion is not guaranteed anymore. This
% on the one hand shows how subtle Peterson's algorithm is. On the other hand
% it shows the effectiveness of tools. It is very hard to detect by human reasoning
% whether exchanging the detectors is safe. When generating the reduced state
% space, it is obvious that it is not safe.
